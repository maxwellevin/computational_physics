# Phys 380: Computational Physics
A collection of Python code I wrote when I took Phys 380: Computation Physics.

Topics studied include Numerical Integration, differentiation, solutions to ODE's, solutions to non-linear Differential Equations, systems of Differential Equations, Chaos, and numerous other specific topics/problems in Physics.
